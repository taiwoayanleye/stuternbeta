ICONS:
	Great Icons conveys not a meaning only, but emotion. It's more like accentuated animated character.
	Great icons aren't solitary, it simulates the reality and that includes staging in it's ecosystem.
	Icons should be bigger than the text inas much picture speaks a thousand word.
	Icons according to Github, no words at all just hover and you would see words.
